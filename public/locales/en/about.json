    "longAboutMe": "Hello! I am Fabio Baquero. I am glad to be able to share with you a bit about me today. I studied theology at Palabra de Vida, a Bible institute in Argentina. I was national director at BSF (Bible Study Fellowship) of Ecuador. I taught the Bible at the Missionary Bible Institute of Ecuador (IBME from its initials in Spanish). I am here because I want to continue doing what makes me passionate, sharing the Word of God and the Gospel of Grace."
